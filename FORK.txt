This project is a fork of the project originally called RulangBridge by Toshi
Hirooka (?) aka tosik. I have done my best to contact the original author but
have received no response. I have also contacted the ruby-talk list to help me
find the original owner but again to no avail. 

Therefore, in the interest of continuing this project I've renamed it and made
my changes. I hope that at some point the original author will find this file
and understand the position I was in. 

Thanks should go out to the original author if they can be found. Until that 
time I hope that this new project can fulfill the same goals.
