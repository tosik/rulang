- Get the erlang adaptor to handle hashes
- Add error checking to the rulang server for things like servers already running on a port.

- database.yml should say where beam/mnesia live
- make record files importable (via rr command)
- make sure when we start mnesia it's not just running over an old mnesia instance.
